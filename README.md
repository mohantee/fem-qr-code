## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This challenge was a good warmup to prepare for the upcoming ones. I focused on writing semantic HTML and writing maintainable CSS. I also learnt the ins and outs of working with Figma assets.

### Continued development

I still need more experience on writing semantic HTML, and maintainable vanilla CSS. This is one of my main goals of undertaking the Front-end Mentor challenges. This was a very basic project so it didn't serve me well for my purposes, but I am looking forward to taking on more challenging projects later.
